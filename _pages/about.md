Hey there, how's it going? I'm Matt, and this is my blog. Here you'll find some topics I decided to write about concerning mobile development.

I got my start developing mobile apps way back in the heyday of iPhone OS 3 - back then we didn't even call it iOS! A friend and I started an ambitious site/app called Locacha, which was a location based chat room. We developed an iPhone and Android app, as well as a web app. After some initial success, the popularity of Locacha dwindled, and we (sadly) had to shut down the server.

Though it was not all for naught - with the experience I gained working on Locacha (as well as some other side projects such as [Hacker News Zero](https://github.com/mds6058/HN-Zero-v2)), I was able to land a job working at a consulting agency - [Mindgrub](https://www.mindgrub.com). At Mindgrub I spent 4 years as a lead mobile developer, working on many iOS and Android projects for many different clients, all with diverse business needs.

After Mindgrub I came on as the sole iOS developer for [LifeJourney](https://lifejourney.us/), where we currently work on serveral education apps and an app for Golfers called [Swing Index](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/swing-index/id1364108595).

What's next? Only time will tell...
