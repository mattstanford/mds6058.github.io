Universal links and custom schemes are one of those things that is always more complicated than you‚Äôve originally thought. It‚Äôs just clicking a link to get into the app, right? Well, if it‚Äôs supposed to take you to a specific view in the app, what if the user is currently in the settings tab when they tap it? What if they‚Äôre on the profile view, and an error modal is currently being displayed?

Sounds like a good thing to have automated testing for right? Unfortunately UI testing for universal links and custom schemes has always been a little perilous.

The current state of UI Testing custom schemes and universal links

Currently, the fastest way to test custom schemes is to use the Safari app that is built into the simulator. Basically you simulate tapping the home button, launch the Safari app, and simulate typing the URL into the address bar. Something like this:

{% highlight swift %}
{% raw %}

 func testSafari() {
        // Launch safari
        let safari = XCUIApplication(bundleIdentifier: "com.apple.mobilesafari")
        safari.launch()
        
        // Make sure Safari‚Äôs URL bar has appeared
        let safariUrlButtonExists = safari.buttons["URL"].waitForExistence(timeout: 5)
        XCTAssert(safariUrlButtonExists)
        
        // Type in the text of the URL
        safari.typeText("testCoco://TEST\n")
        
        // Respond to the modal asking you if it's ok to launch the app
        safari.buttons["Open"].tap()
        
        // Wait for your application to enter the foreground
        _ = app.wait(for: .runningForeground, timeout: 5)
    }

{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

However, using this method will NOT work if you use a universal link. For some reason, iOS only opens a universal link if it is ‚Äútapped on‚Äù. An alternative approach to testing this was written about in a post on Branch.io‚Äôs blog here: [https://blog.branch.io/ui-testing-universal-links-in-xcode-9/](https://blog.branch.io/ui-testing-universal-links-in-xcode-9/). Here‚Äôs a basic rundown of how a UI test using this technique works:
* Put your app in the background with the home button
* Launch the Messages app
* Tap one of the always-present conversations the simulator has (either ‚ÄúKate Bell‚Äù or ‚ÄúJohn Appleseed‚Äù)
* Type in your URL in message box
* Once your url appears in the conversation, tap it
* Your app should launch

Here‚Äôs the process in action:

## **Problems with using Messages**

I personally have been using the Messages approach to UI Testing universal links for a little white now. While the approach the above blog post worked pretty well at first, updates to the Simulator app have continually broken the process. Some things that have thrown me curveballs were:
* Messages now shows a ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs New in Messages‚Äù intro modal view on first run. This happens more often than you might think, for some reason cloned simulators (used when running tests in parallel mode) get started, or if you happen to reset your simulators. This modal must be dismissed IF it‚Äôs shown.
* Messages now also sometimes throws up the ‚Äúnew message‚Äù view on startup. I have not yet been able to determine why and how this happens. If it does happen, it needs to be dismissed so we our test can navigate the main table view of messages.
* Sending a message with no other text but the URL will cause Messages to just remove the message after a second or two. I‚Äôm not sure of the reason of this either, but the solution is send a link with some placeholder text in front of it (like this ‚Äúhere‚Äôs a link: https://my.universallink.com‚Äù)

So as you can see, dealing with messages is kind of a pain. Every new update to Xcode, you may have to go through all your tests that use the Messages app, and make sure nothing broke.

Another thing to add about these tests: they are SLOW. Opening messages, navigating the message list, typing in the URL, takes a good amount of time (even compared to other UI tests).

After a while of dealing with constant maintenance and slowness of these tests, I started to wonder if this was really the best way to go about testing these use cases. It seems like the Messages app is not really intended for testing this scenario - I would wager it is present for the purposes of testing iMessage extensions or Sticker Packs. Using it to test universal links is kind of a hack. 

## **So I Wrote a Library**

I started to think, what would be the IDEAL way to test these? It would probably involve an app on the simulator/phone that was actually designed to test universal links/custom schemes. Also, it should require the least amount of user interaction possible, and launch as fast as possible.

So I wrote an app that does exactly that. This app, which I named ‚ÄúGhostHand‚Äù, can be passed a URL in its launch parameters. Once it‚Äôs launched, it will immediately launch said URL in the "application(didFinishLaunchingWithOptions)‚Äù method. This will work with both custom schemes and universal links.

The tricky part of this was getting this into a library that could be distributed via CocoaPods or Carthage. In the end I got everything to work. The GhostHand app is pre-built and embedded into a framework called ‚ÄúGhostHandLib‚Äù. Any implementor of this library must make sure to run a simple run script in their UI Test target to trigger the install of the app on the simulator they are running the test against.

Here‚Äôs how the app works in practice, assuming you have it configured in your project correctly:

{% highlight swift %}
{% raw %}

 func testSample() {
        app.launch()
        let appBooted = app.staticTexts["Sample App for üëª"].waitForExistence(timeout: 5)
        XCTAssert(appBooted)
        
        //Tap the home button to put the app under test in the background
        XCUIDevice.shared.press(XCUIDevice.Button.home)
        
        //Use the GhostHand companion app to launch the custom scheme
        GhostHand.launch(url: "ghostHandSampleApp://TEST")
        
        //The app should be called by the GhostHand companion app
        let appShowedAgain = app.staticTexts["Sample App for üëª"].waitForExistence(timeout: 5)
        XCTAssert(appShowedAgain)
    }

{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

And here‚Äôs what it looks like in action:
